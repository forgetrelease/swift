/// These utilities model the storage locations of memory access.
///
/// All memory operations that are part of a formal access, as defined by
/// exclusivity rules, are marked by begin_access and end_access instructions.
///
///     Currently, access markers are stripped early in the pipeline. An active
///     goal is to require access markers in OSSA form, and to enable access
///     marker verification.
///
/// To verify access markers, SIL checks that all memory operations either have
/// an address that originates in begin_access, or originates from a pattern
/// that is recognized as a non-formal-access. This implies that every SIL
/// memory operation has a recognizable address source. Given the address of a
/// memory operation, there are three levels of APIs that inspect the origin of
/// that address:
///
/// 1. getAccessAddress(): Find the originating address as close as possible to
/// the address of the formal access *without* looking past any storage
/// casts. This is useful when the type of the returned access address must be
/// consistent with the memory operation's type (the same type or a parent
/// type). For a formal access, this typically returns the begin_access, but it
/// is not guaranteed to because some accesses contain storage casts. For
/// non-formal access, it returns a best-effort address corresponding to the
/// base of an access.
///
/// 2. getAccessBegin(): If the memory operation is part of a formal access,
/// then this is guaranteed to return the begin_access marker. Otherwise, it
/// returns the best-effort address or pointer corresponding to the base of an
/// access. Useful to find the scope of a formal access.
///
/// 3. getAccessBase(): Find the ultimate base of any address corresponding to
/// the accessed object, regardless of whether the address is nested within
/// access scopes, and regardless of any storage casts. This returns either an
/// address type, pointer type, or box type, but never a reference type.
/// Each object's property or its tail storage is separately accessed.
///
/// For better identification an access base, use findAccessedStorage(). It
/// returns an AccessedStorage value that identifies the storage location of a
/// memory access. It provides APIs for inspecting type of accessed storage and
/// allows for disambiguation between different types of storage and different
/// properties within a class.
///
/// findAccessedStorage() follows the same logic as getAccessBase(), but if the
/// base is not recognized as a valid access, it returns invalid
/// AccessedStorage. It also performs further analysis to determine the root
/// reference of an object access.
///
/// findAccessedStorage() returns the outermost AccessedStorage for any memory
/// address. It can be called on the address of a memory operation, the address
/// of a begin_access, or any other address value. If the address is from an
/// enforced begin_access or from any memory operation that is part of a formal
/// access, then it returns a valid AccessedStorage value. If the memory
/// operation is not part of a formal access, then it still identifies the
/// accessed location as a best effort, but the result may be invalid storage.
///
///    An active goal is to require findAccessedStorage() to always return a
///    valid AccessedStorage value even for operations that aren't part of a
///    formal access.
///
/// The AccessEnforcementWMO pass is an example of an optimistic optimization
/// that relies on this requirement for correctness. If findAccessedStorage()
/// simply bailed out on an unrecognized memory address by returning an invalid
/// AccessedStorage, then the optimization could make incorrect assumptions
/// about the absence of access to globals or class properties.
///
/// identifyFormalAccess() is similar to findAccessedStorage(), but returns the
/// formally accessed storage of a begin_access instruction. This must return a
/// valid AccessedStorage value unless the access has "Unsafe" enforcement. The
/// formal access location may be nested within an outer begin_access. For the
/// purpose of exclusivity, nested accesses are considered distinct formal
/// accesses so they return distinct AccessedStorage values even though they may
/// access the same memory.

///     storage must have the same key if they access the same storage and
///     distinct keys if they access distinct storage. For more efficient

///     same key if they may point to the same storage.
///
///     Complete identification of all class or global accesses. Failing to
///     identify a class or global access will introduce undefined program
///     behavior which can't be tested.
///
/// Memory operations on "uniquely identified" storage cannot overlap with any
/// other memory operation on distinct "uniquely identified" storage.
///
/// AccessedStorage may be one of several kinds of "identified" storage
/// objects. Storage is "identified" when the base of the formal access is
/// recognized and the kind of storage precisely identified. The base is usually
/// represented by the SILValue that the memory address is derived from. For
/// global variable access, the base is the global's declaration instead.
///
/// Unidentified *valid* storage is also associated with a SILValue that
/// produces the accessed address but that value has not been determined to be
/// the base of a formal access. It may be from a ref_tail_addr, undef, or some
/// recognized memory initialization pattern. Unidentified valid storage cannot
/// represent any arbitrary base address--it must at least been proven not to
/// correspond to any class or global variable access, unless it's nested within
/// another access to the same object. So, Unidentified can overlap with
/// Class/Global access, but it cannot be the only formal access to that memory.
///
/// An *invalid* AccessedStorage object is Unidentified and associated with an
/// invalid SILValue. This signals that analysis has failed to recognize an
/// expected address producer pattern.
///
///     An active goal is to enforce that every memory operation's
///     AccessedStorage is either valid or explicitly guarded by an "unsafe"
///     begin_access.
///
/// Note that the SILValue that represents a storage object is not
/// necessarilly an address type. It may instead be a SILBoxType. So, even
/// though address phis are not allowed, finding the base of an access may
/// require traversing phis.

/// Identify an addressable location based the AccessedStorage and projection

/// Each unique path from a base address implies a unique memory location within
/// that object. A path prefix identifies memory that contains all paths with
/// the same prefix. The AccessPath returned by AccessPath::compute(address)
/// identifies the object seen by any memory operation that *directly* operates
/// on 'address'. The computed path is a prefix of the paths of any contained
/// subobjects.
///
/// Path indices, encoded by AccessPath::Index, may be either subobject
/// projections or offset indices. We print subobject indices as '#n' and offset
/// indices as '@n'.
///
/// Example Def->Use: (Path indices)
///   struct_element_addr #1: (#1)
///   ref_tail_addr -> struct_element_addr #2: (#2)
///   ref_tail_addr -> index_addr #1 -> struct_element_addr #2: (@1, #2)
///   pointer_to_address -> struct_element_addr #2: (#2)
///   pointer_to_address -> index_addr #1 -> struct_element_addr #2: (@1, #2)
///
/// The index of ref_element_addr is part of the storage identity and does
/// not contribute to the access path indices.
///
/// A well-formed path has at most one offset component at the begining of the
/// path (chained index_addrs are merged into one offset). In other words,
/// taking an offset from a subobject projection is not well-formed access
/// path. However, it is possible (however undesirable) for programmers to
/// convert a subobject address into a pointer (for example, via implicit
/// conversion), then advance that pointer. Since we can't absolutely prevent
/// this, we instead consider it an invalid AccessPath. This is the only case in
/// which AccessPath::storage can differ from findAccessedStorage().
///
/// Storing an AccessPath ammortizes to constant space. To cache identification
/// of address locations, AccessPath should be used rather than the
